        <h2>What is CLS?</h2>
        <p>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a metric that measures the visual stability of a web page. It quantifies how much the content on the page unexpectedly shifts during the loading phase.
             A low CLS score indicates that the page is stable and provides a good user experience, while a high CLS score means that elements on the page are moving around, which can be frustrating for users.</p>

            <p>CLS is one of the Core Web Vitals, and it is important for SEO because it affects the user experience. A good CLS score is less than 0.1.</p>
